					<h3>Private Consulting</h3>

				<p>You're looking for more one-on-one assistance. You need an hour...maybe two...to just hash through some things and get some clarity. We're happy to put some time on the books to get our hands dirty! We want to understand your problem so we can craft a creative and efficient solution.</p>

					<h3>Popup Consulting</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This is our version of "try it out and let us know if it works for you."</p>
                <p>Our belief is that there is a stigma around the word "consulting," and our hope is that through these "popup" consultation sessions we can slowly but surely make consulting not seem so formal.</p>
                <p>Here's how they work:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We put dates on the calendar usually a quarter in advance</li>
                    <li>The cost to you is $1/minute...and there's only a $5 minimum. If you need 10 minutes of our time, you only pay $10. If you need 30 minutes of our time, you pay $30.</li>
                    <li>It's first-come, first-serve. No appointments are necessary.</li>
                    <li>You don't have to give us a heads up you're coming. We'll let you know where we'll be and all you have to do is show up and we'll be happy to talk with you.</li>
                </ul> 
				<ul class="actions">
					<li><a href="generic.html" class="button">Find the next popup events</a></li>
				</ul>

					<h3>Small Business Consulting</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Yes, we're a small business. We also have friends who are small business owners. Needless to say, we've seen a few things. This isn't our main area of expertise but it IS who are clients are. It's more than about tech, or the design, or the branding, it's about how it all works together. These sessions are more about how to create the ecosystem.</p>
