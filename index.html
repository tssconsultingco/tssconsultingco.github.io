        <h2><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span>Design</h2>
        <div class="hr"></div>

        <p><strong>How does the design process work?</strong>
        Though every project is different, here's what you can generally expect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First we'll sit down and talk about the objectives of what you need designed</li>
          <li>We'll create a round of concepts</li>
          <li>You'll review them and select which one to proceed with</li>
          <li>We'll create a round of revisions</li>
          <li>You'll review those and select which one to proceed with</li>
          <li>We'll create a final design</li>
          <li>You sign off of the design, then we handoff the assets to you in the format you need.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What's your price range?</strong>
        Generally we start around $250 but it could easily go up from there. If you need something on a smaller budget, don't hesitate to talk with us and we'll see what we can do.</p>

        <p><strong>Do you do package bundles?</strong>
        Absolutely! We have from time to time offered package deals for our clients. For example, if your design project cost is $250 and your development cost is $1000, we may offer a 5-10% discount. </p>

        <p><strong>Do you print the designs as well?</strong>
        No, we aren't in the printing business. If you have a specified vendor, we can work with their templates in terms of what's needed to send them a file that'll accomplish what you need. At this time, however, we aren't able to provide printing services for your design.</p>

        <p><strong>What's the first step to begin a design project?</strong>
        First, click the "Start a design project' button on the site. After we receive your submission, we would setup a short meeting with you so that we understand what you're looking for in your project. This meeting could be virtual or in-person.</p>

        <p><strong>How many people would I be interacting with during my project?</strong>
        Generally you'd interact with one or two people. We like to keep things simple. We also like to develop relationships with our clients. The person you start with is most likely the person you'll continue with.</p>

        <p><strong>What's the turnaround time for a project?</strong>
        It depends on the project scope. Generally we'd like to turnaround projects within a 3-4 week timeframe. When we create the project proposal we outline a tentative timeline so you can see how the components work.</p>

        <p><strong>Can I receive the source files once the project is completed?</strong>
        That is an option we give to our clients, at an extra cost. Included in every project is the final assets provided securely in the format you request.</p>

        <h2><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span>Development</h2>
        <div class="hr"></div>

        <p><strong>What can I expect in the development process?</strong>
        Though every project is different, here's what you can generally expect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First we'll sit down and talk about the objectives of what you need developed</li>
          <li>We'll determine the appropriate platform and technology to use to properly execute the project</li>
          <li>There would be cycles of review and resolve</li>
          <li>We might suggest sharing a beta of the site with trusted associates to make sure we're hitting the objectives for the right audience</li>
          <li>There would be testing of the site in both laptop/desktop and mobile devices</li>
          <li>We'd talk through a launch strategy and progressive enhancements/future phases</li>
          <li>Once the site goes live, we'll test again and talk through any documentation needed for future updates</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What's the price range for development work?</strong>
        Static websites start at approximately $500. Websites that involve more interactivity or e-commerce integration would start at $1,000. We don't charge so much based on number of pages, but we look at the project overall and provide a project quote.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Do you build mobile applications?</strong>
        Though, not our primary expertise, we do have the possibility of creating a mobile app for your needs. We recognize in today's world that mobile applications are in greater demand and there are ways to create websites as we know it in a way that's geared for mobile devices.<br><br>We wouldn't do apps that would JUST work on a specific platform&mdash;for example&mdash;an Android-only app, or an iOS-only app. Any mobile applications would cover both Android and iOS and possibly other lesser-known platforms like the Kindle Fire, etc.</p>

        <p><strong>Do you build sites from scratch?</strong>
        That is one of the ways we can build a site, but it's not the only way. Sometimes we utilize an existing platform and build on top of it. Platforms we've worked with before include Wordpress and Squarespace, just to name a couple.</p>

        <p><strong>Do you host websites yourself?</strong>
        No, we don't provide hosting services. We'd work with a third-party vendor or other development platform to provide the hosting for your website. This would be a cost that is payable to that vendor, not to us.</p>

        <p><strong>Do you assist with domain names?</strong>
        Yes, we can help you determine the best domain name strategy for your project.</p>

        <p><strong>I'm not sure how to write the content for my website. Can you assist with content writing?</strong>
        Generally, yes. The caveat is that we feel that you know your business/brand better than we do. Even though we have experience with a number of industries, it's always better coming from you. We can take the information you provide us and massage it in a way that's helpful for your project. Depending on the sensitivity of the content, we may recommend you seek a content writer for creation and/or editing to make sure you're providing accurate and appropriate content to your audience.</p>

        <p><strong>Do you manage the websites you create?</strong>
        We can. If we're tasked to manage the website(s) we create, we would establish a retainer agreement for a specified term. If you have someone in your organization who would be handling the management of the website once it's created we can provide documentation on how to update it moving forward.</p>
        
        <p><strong>What is the turnaround time for a web project?</strong>
        If the project is small in scope, you could expect the project to last 6-8 weeks. If the project is larger in scope, it could go 3-6 months. The project proposal we provide would give you the estimated time it would take to complete your specific project.</p>

        <p><strong>Do you use coding best practices?</strong>
        Yes.</p>

        <p><strong>Can we get the files for the website once the project is complete?</strong>
        Unfortunately, there's not always an easy way to provide the files for an entire website. We do, when possible, create backups of the site on a regular basis in case the internet (or the platform) decides to go on vacation. If we are able to create a full zip of the website, we can provide that for an extra cost.</p>

        <h2><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span>Consulting</h2>
        <div class="hr"></div>

        <p><strong>What types of consultations do you offer?</strong>
        We have two primary offerings. Our popup consultations which usually happen near our homebase&mdash;the Chicagoland area&mdash;provide our clients an informal setting where there's no set time limit and no set cost. You pay for the time you use; it's first come, first serve.<br><br>Our private consultations have set timeframes from 30 minutes to about two hours.<br><br>In addition to these, we offer consultative services such as code reviews, design feedback, concept brainstorming, etc.</p>

        <p><strong>How often do the popups happen?</strong>
        Generally popups happen once a month. We announce here on the website, as well as our social media outlets when we're having a popup session. They usually last from 2-3 hours at a coffeehouse or cafe.</p>

        <p><strong>What should I bring to a consultation?</strong>
        Bring an open mind, any documents you want to review, and of course you! Feel free to come with an associate if you feel it helpful to explain things.</p>

        <p><strong>Do you just consult on design and development?</strong>
        No! We are a small business, so we do some general consulting around topics related to small business. We can consult around branding, social media, and other avenues of technology (e.g. photography, videography, etc.).</p>

        <p><strong>Is there a limit to the number of consultations I can do?</strong>
        Absolutely not. Feel free to show up at any of our popups, or book as many private consultations as you feel you need.</p>
